  Android Auto Backup configuration for GAUwallet

  Auto Backup automatically backs up app data to Google Drive when:
  - User has enabled backup in Android settings
  - Device is idle, charging, and connected to Wi-Fi
  - Less than 24 hours have passed since last backup

  Estimated adoption: 60-70% of Android users have backup enabled

  CRITICAL SECURITY NOTE:
  - flutter_secure_storage is EXCLUDED because Android Keystore keys DO NOT transfer between devices
  - If Keystore data was backed up, decryption would fail on restore (keys are hardware-bound)
  - Our wallet_backup.txt file is INCLUDED for automatic cloud backup
